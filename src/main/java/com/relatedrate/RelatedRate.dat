Consider a right triangle which is changing shape in the following way. The horizontal leg is increasing at the rate of :dA: inches per minute and the vertical leg is increasing at the rate of :dB: inches per minute At what rate is the hypotenuse changing when the horizontal leg is :A: inches and the vertical leg is :B: inches? [dC]{A>0;B>0;}|C^2=A^2+B^2|
Consider a crane that is moving in the following way. The crane is traveling forward at rate of :dA: meters per minute and the crane is lifting its arm at a rate of :dB: meters per minute At what rate is the distance between the crane's arm's original position and its new position changing when the crane has moved forward :A: meters and has lifted its arm :B: meters? [dC]{A>0;B>0;}|C^2=A^2+B^2|
