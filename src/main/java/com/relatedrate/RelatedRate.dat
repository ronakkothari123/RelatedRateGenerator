Consider a right triangle which is changing shape in the following way. The horizontal leg is increasing at the rate of :dA: inches per minute and the vertical leg is increasing at the rate of :dB: inches per minute At what rate is the hypotenuse changing when the horizontal leg is :A: inches and the vertical leg is :B: inches? [dC]{A>0;B>0;}|C^2=A^2+B^2|
A ladder is leaning against a wall. The ladder is :C: feet long, and it is sliding down the wall at a rate of :dB: feet per second. How fast is the base of the ladder moving away from the wall when the top of the ladder is :B: feet above the ground? [dA]{dC=0;C>20;dB>0;A>10}|C^2=A^2+B^2|
